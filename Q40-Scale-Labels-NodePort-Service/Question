In namespace `prod`, a Deployment named `nginx-deployment` exists.

Perform the following tasks:

1. Scale the Deployment to `2` replicas.
2. Add the label `role=webFrontEnd` to the Pod template metadata.

Next, create a NodePort Service in namespace `prod` with the following specifications:

- Name: `rover`
- Type: `NodePort`
- Port: `80`
- The Service must expose the `nginx-deployment` Pods

Verify that the Service has endpoints and the Pods are accessible.
