A Deployment named `honeybee-deployment` in namespace `gorilla` has Pods that are logging RBAC errors.

The error message is:
`User "system:serviceaccount:gorilla:default" cannot list resource "pods" [...] in the namespace "gorilla"`

Task:

1. Check the Pod logs to confirm the authorization error.
2. Identify the correct ServiceAccount that has the required permissions to list Pods in namespace `gorilla`.
   (Hint: check existing ServiceAccounts and RoleBindings in the namespace)
3. Update the Deployment `honeybee-deployment` to use the correct ServiceAccount.

Note:
- The honeybee-deployment's manifest file can be found at `/home/candidate/prompt-escargot/honeybee-deployment.yaml`
- Do not create new Roles or RoleBindings — the correct ones already exist.
- Verify that the Pods no longer log authorization errors after the fix.
