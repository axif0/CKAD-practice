A team has a HorizontalPodAutoscaler manifest that was originally created for an older Kubernetes cluster.
The manifest file is located at `~/ckad-hpa.yaml`.

When applying it to the current cluster (Kubernetes v1.32), it fails due to deprecated API version and spec format.

Task:

1. Identify the correct API version for HorizontalPodAutoscaler on Kubernetes v1.32.
2. Update the manifest to use the correct API version and fix any deprecated fields in the spec.
3. Apply the updated manifest and verify that the HPA is created successfully.

Note:
- You may use `kubectl explain` or the Kubernetes documentation to find the correct API version and spec format.
