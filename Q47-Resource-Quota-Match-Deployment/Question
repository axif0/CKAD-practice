Update the `nginx-resources` Deployment in the namespace with the following resource settings:

Requests:
- 100m CPU requests
- 128Mi memory requests

Limits:
- Set the limits to double the resource requests for CPU and memory

Next, ensure that the total amount of resources in the namespace matches 
the maximum resources the Pods from the `nginx-resources` Deployment can request.

Note:
- Do not delete the existing Deployment
- Failure to do so will result in a reduced score
