In namespace `default`, four NetworkPolicies already exist:
- `deny-all-backend`
- `allow-frontend-to-backend`
- `allow-monitor-to-backend`
- `unrelated-policy`

You are NOT allowed to create, delete, or edit any NetworkPolicy resources.

Three Pods exist: `db-pod`, `api-pod`, and `monitor-pod`. Currently, the `db-pod` cannot receive traffic from the other Pods due to missing or incorrect labels.

Task:

Update the Pod labels so that:

1. `db-pod` has labels: `app=db`, `tier=backend`
2. `api-pod` has labels: `app=api`, `tier=frontend`
3. `monitor-pod` has label: `role=monitor`

This should allow the `api-pod` and `monitor-pod` to send traffic to `db-pod` as permitted by the existing NetworkPolicies.

Verify that the NetworkPolicies select the correct Pods after updating labels.
