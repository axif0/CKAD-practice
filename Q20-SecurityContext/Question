Modify the existing Deployment named `hotfix-deployment` running in namespace `quetzal` so that its containers:

1. Run with user ID `30000` (Pod-level securityContext)
2. Forbid privilege escalation on all containers (container-level securityContext)

Note:
- The hotfix-deployment's manifest file can be found at ~/broker-deployment/hotfix-deployment.yaml
- Do not delete or recreate the Deployment; apply the changes in-place
