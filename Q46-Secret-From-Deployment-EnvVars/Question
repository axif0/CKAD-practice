First, create a single new Secret named `postgres` in the `relaxed-shark` namespace.

It must contain the three pieces of secret information currently hard-coded in 
Pod environment variables in the Deployment `postgres` running in the `relaxed-shark` namespace.

Use the keys: `username`, `database`, and `password`.

Next, modify the Deployment so that:
- The environment variables are sourced from the Secret instead of hard-coded values
