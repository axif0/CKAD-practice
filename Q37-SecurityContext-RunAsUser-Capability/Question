Modify the existing Deployment named `store-deployment` running in namespace `grubworm` so that its containers:

1. Run with user ID `10000` (set at Pod-level `securityContext.runAsUser`)
2. Have the `NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability added (set at container-level `securityContext.capabilities.add`)

Note:
- The store-deployment's manifest file can be found at `/home/candidate/daring-moccasin/store-deployment.yaml`
- Apply the changes and verify the securityContext is correctly set on the running Pods.
