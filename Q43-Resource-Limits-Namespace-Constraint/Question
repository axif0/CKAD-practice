The Pod for the Deployment named `nosql` in namespace `haddock` fails to start because its container exceeds the namespace resource constraints.

Task:

Update the `nosql` Deployment so that the container has the following resource settings:

- Memory request: `128Mi`
- Memory limit: half the maximum memory constraint set for the `haddock` namespace

Steps:
1. Check the LimitRange in namespace `haddock` to find the maximum memory constraint.
2. Calculate half of that value and set it as the memory limit.
3. Apply the updated manifest.

Note:
- The nosql Deployment's manifest file can be found at `/home/candidate/chief-cardinal/nosql.yaml`
- Verify that the Pod starts successfully after the update.
