An application named `webapp` has two versions running in namespace `production`:
- version `v1` (stable)
- version `v2` (new)

Both versions must be accessible over a single Service named `webapp-svc`.

Requirements:
1. Approximately 80% of traffic should be routed to `v1`.
2. Approximately 20% of traffic should be routed to `v2`.
3. Use only Kubernetes-native objects (Deployments and Service).
4. Do not use Ingress, Service Mesh, or external load balancers.

Configure the required Kubernetes resources to satisfy the above requirements.

Hint: Use replica-based traffic splitting — the Service should select Pods from both Deployments using a shared label.
