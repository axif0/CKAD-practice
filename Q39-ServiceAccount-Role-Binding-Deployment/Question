In namespace `cute-panda`, a Deployment named `scraper` exists but its Pods are using the `default` ServiceAccount.

Task:

1. Create a new ServiceAccount named `scraper` in namespace `cute-panda`.
2. Review the existing Roles in namespace `cute-panda` and identify the best-fitting Role for the `scraper` workload.
3. Create a RoleBinding to bind the identified Role to the new ServiceAccount `scraper`.
4. Update the `scraper` Deployment to use ServiceAccount `scraper`.

Note:
- Multiple Roles exist in the namespace — choose the one most appropriate for the workload.
- Verify that the Deployment's Pods are running with the correct ServiceAccount after the update.
