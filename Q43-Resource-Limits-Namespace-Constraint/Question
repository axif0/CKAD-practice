The Pod for the Deployment named `nosql` in the `haddock` namespace fails to start
because its Container runs out of resources.

Update the `nosql` Deployment so that the Container:
- requests 128Mi of memory
- limits the memory to half the maximum memory constraint set for the `haddock` namespace

Note:
- The nosql Deployment's manifest file can be found at /home/candidate/chief-cardinal/nosql.yaml
- Check LimitRange in haddock namespace to find max memory constraint
