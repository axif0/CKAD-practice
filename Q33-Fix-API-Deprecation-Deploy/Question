A manifest file located at `/home/candidate/credible-mite/web.yaml` was originally written for Kubernetes v1.15.

The current cluster runs Kubernetes v1.29+, and the manifest fails to apply due to deprecated API versions.

Task:

1. Identify and fix all API deprecation issues in the manifest file.
2. Ensure required fields (such as `spec.selector`) are present for the current API version.
3. Deploy the application using the updated manifest in namespace `garfish`.
4. Verify that the Deployment and Service are running successfully.

Note:
- The manifest may contain both Deployment and Service resources.
- Use `kubectl api-versions` or Kubernetes documentation to identify the correct API versions.
