In namespace `resource-test`, a Deployment named `nginx-resources` exists and a ResourceQuota named `compute-quota` is configured.

Task:

1. Update the `nginx-resources` Deployment with the following resource settings:
   - CPU request: `100m`
   - Memory request: `128Mi`
   - CPU limit: `200m` (double the CPU request)
   - Memory limit: `256Mi` (double the memory request)

2. Update the ResourceQuota `compute-quota` so that the total allowed resources in the namespace exactly match the maximum resources the Pods from the `nginx-resources` Deployment can consume.
   (Hint: multiply per-Pod limits by the number of replicas)

Note:
- Do NOT delete the existing Deployment.
- Verify that both the Deployment Pods and ResourceQuota are correctly configured.
