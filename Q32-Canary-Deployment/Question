In namespace `default`, a Deployment named `web-stable` and a Service named `web-svc` already exist.

Implement a canary release for the application using replica-based traffic splitting.

Requirements:

1. The stable Deployment (`web-stable`) must:
   - Use image `nginx:1.14`
   - Run `3` replicas
   - Have label `app=web` in its Pod template

2. Create a new canary Deployment named `web-canary` that:
   - Uses image `nginx:1.16`
   - Runs `1` replica
   - Has label `app=web` in its Pod template (same as stable)

3. Do not modify the Service `web-svc`. The Service selects on `app=web`, so both Deployments' Pods will automatically receive traffic.

Verify that the Service endpoints include all 4 Pods (3 stable + 1 canary).
