In namespace `relaxed-shark`, a Deployment named `postgres` exists with hard-coded environment variables containing sensitive data.

Task:

1. Inspect the Deployment to identify the three hard-coded environment variables.
2. Create a single Secret named `postgres` in namespace `relaxed-shark` containing these values with the keys:
   - `username`
   - `database`
   - `password`

3. Modify the Deployment so that the environment variables are sourced from the Secret using `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` instead of hard-coded values.

Note:
- Do not change the environment variable names in the Deployment (e.g., `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`).
- Verify that the Secret is created correctly and the Deployment restarts with the updated configuration.
