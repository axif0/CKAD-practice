Update the Pod `newpod` in the `charming-macaw` namespace to use a NetworkPolicy
allowing the Pod to send and receive traffic only to and from the Pods `front` and `db`.

Note:
- All required NetworkPolicies have already been created.
- You must not create, delete, or edit any NetworkPolicy resources.
- You may only modify Pod labels.
