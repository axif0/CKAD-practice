In namespace `charming-macaw`, a Pod named `newpod` exists along with Pods named `front` and `db`.

A NetworkPolicy named `allow-middle-traffic` already exists and controls traffic flow between these Pods.
The NetworkPolicy selects Pods using a specific label.

Currently, `newpod` cannot send or receive traffic to/from `front` and `db`.

Task:

Update the labels on Pod `newpod` so that it is selected by the `allow-middle-traffic` NetworkPolicy, allowing it to send and receive traffic to and from the `front` and `db` Pods.

Note:
- All required NetworkPolicies have already been created.
- You must NOT create, delete, or edit any NetworkPolicy resources.
- You may only modify Pod labels.
- Use `kubectl describe netpol` to identify the required label.
