A Deployment named `content-marlin-deployment` running in namespace `content-marlin` is exposed via an Ingress named `content-marlin-ingress`.

The Deployment is supposed to be reachable at:
`http://content-marlin.local/content-marlin`

However, requesting this URL currently returns an error.

Task:

Identify and fix the problems in the Service and/or Ingress so that the Deployment becomes externally reachable as planned.

The manifest files for the Deployment, Service, and Ingress can be found at:
`/home/candidate/content-marlin/`

Note:
- Do NOT modify the Deployment.
- You may only modify the Service and/or Ingress.
- Common issues include: incorrect Service selector, wrong port mapping, or mismatched Ingress backend service name/port.
- Verify that the Service has endpoints after fixing.
