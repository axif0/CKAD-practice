A Deployment named `content-marlin-deployment`, running in namespace `content-marlin`
is exposed via Ingress `content-marlin-ingress`.

The manifest files for the Deployment, Service and Ingress can be found at
/home/candidate/content-marlin/

The Deployment is supposed to be reachable at http://content-marlin.local/content-marlin
but requesting this URL is currently returning an error.

Identify and fix the problems by updating the associated resources so that the
Deployment becomes externally reachable as planned.

Note:
- Don't modify the Deployment; you can modify Service and Ingress.
