A Dockerfile has been prepared at /home/candidate/build/Dockerfile.

Using the prepared Dockerfile, build a container image with the name `macaque` and tag `1.2`.
You may install and use the tool of your choice.

Note:
- Multiple image builders and tools have been pre-installed: docker, skopeo, buildah, img, and podman.
- Please do not push the built image to a registry, run a container, or otherwise consume it.
- Using the tool of your choice, export the built container image in OCI or Docker image format and store it at /home/candidate/macaque-1.2.tar
