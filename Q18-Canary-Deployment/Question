Canary Deployment
==================

Implement a canary release for the web application:

Requirements:
1. Scale the existing 'web-stable' deployment to 3 replicas
2. Create a new deployment named 'web-canary' with:
   - Image: nginx:1.16
   - Replicas: 1
   - Labels: app=web and version=canary
3. Ensure both deployments share the label app=web so they are served by the existing Service 'web-svc'
4. Do NOT modify the Service

Verification:
- Total of 4 pods should be running (3 stable + 1 canary)
- Service should route traffic to all 4 pods (75% stable, 25% canary)
- Check endpoints: kubectl get endpoints web-svc
