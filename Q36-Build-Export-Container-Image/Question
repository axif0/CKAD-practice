A Dockerfile has been prepared at `/home/candidate/build/Dockerfile`.

Task:

1. Using the prepared Dockerfile, build a container image with the name `macaque` and tag `1.2`.
   You may use the tool of your choice.

2. Export the built container image in OCI or Docker image format and store it at:
   `/home/candidate/macaque-1.2.tar`

Note:
- Multiple image builders and tools have been pre-installed: `docker`, `skopeo`, `buildah`, `img`, and `podman`.
- Do NOT push the built image to a registry.
- Do NOT run a container from the image.
- Verify that the tar file exists after export.
