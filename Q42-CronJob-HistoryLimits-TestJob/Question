Create a CronJob named `grep` that executes a Pod running the following single container:
  name: busybox
  image: busybox:stable
  command: ["grep", "-i", "nameserver", "/etc/resolv.conf"]

Configure the CronJob to:
- execute once every 30 minutes
- keep 96 completed Jobs
- keep 192 failed Jobs
- never restart Pods
- terminate Pods after 8 seconds

Manually create and execute one Job named `grep-test` from the `grep` CronJob for testing purposes.
