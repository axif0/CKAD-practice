Modify the existing Deployment named `store-deployment`, running in namespace `grubworm`,
so that its containers:
- run with user ID 10000 and
- have the NET_BIND_SERVICE capability added

Note:
- The store-deployment's manifest file can be found at /home/candidate/daring-moccasin/store-deployment.yaml
