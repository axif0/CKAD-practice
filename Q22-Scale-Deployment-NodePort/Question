A Deployment named `nov2025-deployment` has already been deployed to the namespace `nov2025`.

Task:

1. Scale the Deployment to `4` replicas.
2. Add the label `func=webFrontend` to the Pod template metadata.

Next, create a Service in namespace `nov2025` with the following specifications:

- Name: `berry`
- Type: `NodePort`
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: `8080`
- The Service must select Pods from the `nov2025-deployment` using the label `func=webFrontend`

Verify that the Service has endpoints pointing to all 4 Pods.
