In namespace `meta`, a Deployment named `dev-deployment` exists.
Its Pods run a `kubectl` loop that tries to list Deployments in the same namespace, but logs an authorization error.

Without deleting the Deployment, perform the following:

1. Create a ServiceAccount named `dev-sa` in namespace `meta`.
2. Create a Role named `dev-deploy-role` in namespace `meta` that allows the verbs `get`, `list`, and `watch` on the resource `deployments` in API group `apps`.
3. Create a RoleBinding named `dev-deploy-rb` in namespace `meta` that binds `dev-deploy-role` to ServiceAccount `dev-sa`.
4. Update Deployment `dev-deployment` so that its Pods use ServiceAccount `dev-sa`.

After completing these steps, verify that the Pods can successfully list Deployments without authorization errors.
