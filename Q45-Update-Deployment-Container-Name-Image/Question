Update the existing Deployment `busybox` running in the namespace `rapid-goat`.

Do not delete the existing Deployment. Failure to do so will result in a zero score.

Tasks:
1. First, change the container name to `musl`
2. Next, change the container image to `busybox:musl`
3. Finally, ensure that the changes to the `busybox` Deployment are rolled out
