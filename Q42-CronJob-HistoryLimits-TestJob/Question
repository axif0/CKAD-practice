Create a CronJob named `grep` with the following specifications:

Container:
- Name: `busybox`
- Image: `busybox:stable`
- Command: `["grep", "-i", "nameserver", "/etc/resolv.conf"]`

CronJob configuration:
- Schedule: every 30 minutes
- `successfulJobsHistoryLimit`: 96
- `failedJobsHistoryLimit`: 192
- `restartPolicy`: Never
- `activeDeadlineSeconds`: 8

After creating the CronJob, manually create a Job named `grep-test` from the `grep` CronJob for testing purposes.

Verify that the test Job completes successfully and check its logs.
