In namespace `default`, a Service named `store-svc` exists and the corresponding Pods with label `app=store` are running.

However, traffic is not reaching the Pods — the Service has no endpoints.

Task:

Investigate the Service selector and fix it so that the Service correctly selects the Pods and traffic flows as expected.

Note:
- Do not create new Pods or Services.
- Do not modify Pod labels.
- Only fix the Service selector.
